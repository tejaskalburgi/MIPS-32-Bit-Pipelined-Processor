# Pipelined-MIPS32-Processor-Implementation-in-Verilog
The processor utilizes a pipelined architecture composed of five stages which are Instruction Fetch (IF), Instruction Decode(ID), Execute 
(EX), Memory Access (MEM), and Write-Back (WB).
Implemented various addressing modes such as Direct Register Addressing(RR), Register Immediate Addressing(RM), and Relative addressing 
integrated with several ALU functions.
